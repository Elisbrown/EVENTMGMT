# Event Portal

This is a simple Node.js and Express application that allows users to submit event details along with images. The application uses MySQL for data storage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and npm.
- You have a MySQL server running.

## Installing Event Portal

To install Event Portal, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/elisbrown/event-portal.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd event-portal`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Configuring the Database

This application uses a MySQL database. You need to create a database and a table named `events` with the following columns: `images`, `title`, `description`, `date`, `time`, `venue`.

Update the database connection details in `app.js`:

```javascript
const pool = mysql.createPool({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'Sunyin',
    password: 'test.dev$',
    database: 'event_portal',
    port: 3306,  
});
